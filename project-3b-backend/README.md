# Project 3b Backend

This directory contains code for the backend part of the application. The backend is written in
JavaScript using Node.js with Express.

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

First, you'll need to install the dependency management tool:

- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

### Building and Running

In the project directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. To run the
application in the development environment, run `npm run start:dev`.

> Note: `npm start` can also be run instead of `npm run start:dev`, however, this will not utilise
> `nodemon` and hence the application will not be restarted automatically upon changes to the code.

### Testing

For the Node backend tests, make sure you have already run `npm install` and then `npm test` in
the project directory.
